# CareerBot is a project that will get job postings off online
# job boards (Angellist, Dice, Indeed, etc.) and sort the jobs.
# Then it will create relevant statistics that the user can use
# to set a 'baseline' for acceptable jobs that meant their criteria.
# CareerBot will then weigh jobs based on a variety of factors.
# Finally, CareerBot will send an email to each company in the top 
# ranking percentiles with using a personalized template that inserts
# relevant company information and attaches a resume.
#
# The goals of this project are to save countless hours that are 
# normally spent job hunting, to become well-informed on the current
# job market, and to deliver a quality personalized cover email

# TODO: Perform A/B split testing of emails?
# Create tests to make sure every template email is error free; REGEX ?

# Since I'm newer to Python coding, most of my code will initially
# be in the __init__.py file. I know that this is bad practice, however,
# I'm trying to focus on learning the program first. I'll go back and
# fix my improper folder structuring afterwards.
