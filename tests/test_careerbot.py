# Tests TODO:
# -validate and sanitize any data coming into your DB
# -create general test script that will see how a function handles numerous generic
#  inputs (i.e. 0, -1, 0.9, large numbers, strings, bools, dividing, escape characters)
# -verify template email does not contain ANY errors (grammar, spelling, punctuation).
#  Must test template vs MANY different samples and create a test that can detect this
#  issues (if not too time consuming). Validate that foreign names are handled. REGEX?
#  *** DO NOT SEND ANY EMAILS UNTIL THIS IS DONE - ONE MISTAKE MAY LOSE A DREAM JOB ***
#
# -validate that emails are sending correctly; you can test with personal email
#  and junk email accounts. Make sure these don't get Marked as Spam (change User-Agent)
# -a test for trying to massively skew or break my statistics
# -BONUS POINTS: Perform A/B split testing of emails and which better more responses.
