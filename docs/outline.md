# Project Outline


### Startup

1. Create a basic project outline and break it up into chunks.
2. Break each chunk down into more refined, discrete parts.
3. Before starting work each day, review the outline *maintain scope* and see the ***big picture***.

#### Future features (After v1.0)

- Have CareerBot edit my Resume by searching for relevant keywords in a job listing and reorganizing my skills to fit those keywords (The goal is to personalize as if I was rewriting it - not to be disingenuous).
- Add addition job-board websites to CareerBot
