# CareerBot

**CareerBot** is a project that will get job postings off online
job boards (Angellist, Dice, Indeed, etc.) and sort the jobs.
It will then create relevant statistics that the user can use
to set a *baseline* for acceptable jobs that meant their criteria.
CareerBot will weigh jobs based on a variety of factors and rank them.
Finally, CareerBot will create a personalized letter for each company using
a template to insert relevant company information and send an email with
the custom cover letter and attached resume to each *qualified* job posting.

The goal of this project is to save the numerous hours I'd normally spend job hunting
and to gain insight on the developer job market so I can focus my skillset.

Since I'm newer to Python coding, most of my code will initially
be in the __init__.py file. I know that this is bad practice, however,
I'm trying to focus on learning the program first. I'll go back and
fix my improper folder structuring afterwards.
